# Backend-Blog-App
This project represents a backend blog application developed with Express, Node.js, and MongoDB using Mongoose. The primary focus is on 
building a RESTful API that supports user authentication and blog management. Users can sign up, log in, and create blogs, with each blog 
tied to the respective user. Leveraging MongoDB for data storage, the application ensures a seamless correlation between user information 
and blog data. The RESTful API includes endpoints for user authentication, such as signing up and logging in, as well as blog operations 
like retrieving all blogs, fetching a specific blog by ID, creating new blogs, updating existing ones, and deleting blogs.
